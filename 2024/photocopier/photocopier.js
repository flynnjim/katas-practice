/*
The photocopier function takes in a blueprint to photocopy, which will be a flat (un-nested) object that has a key of isCopy which is false, and at least one other property.

The function returns a copy of that object, with isCopy set to true.

This function needs to be pure, so in your tests you should check:

The copy that the function returns isnâ€™t accidentally the same object as the blueprint that was passed in.
The original blueprint object is unchanged.
